1,Trouble connecting my new headphones,"Hi Support,
I bought the SonicBoom Wireless Headphones last Tuesday, and I’m having a really hard time keeping them connected to my phone. They pair fine initially, but after about 10 minutes, the audio cuts out completely. I’ve tried resetting them and forgetting the device on my iPhone, but the issue persists. Can someone help me troubleshoot this? I need them for my commute.
Best regards,
Jason Miller"

I have already checked my system specs and I definitely have enough RAM. Please let me know how to fix this so I can get back to work.
Thanks,

3,Watch battery draining too fast,"To whom it may concern,
I’ve noticed that my Apex Smartwatch Gen 5 is barely lasting half a day on a full charge. The advertising said it should last 48 hours. I’m not even using the GPS features, just basic notifications. Is my unit defective or is there a setting I need to change?
Sincerely,

I purchased the PrintMaster 5000 for our small office last week. We managed to get it working via USB, but the wireless feature is failing.

We need this wireless for our mobile devices.
Thanks,
