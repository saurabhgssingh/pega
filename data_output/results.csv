1,Trouble connecting my new headphones,"Hi Support,
I bought the SonicBoom Wireless Headphones last Tuesday, and I’m having a really hard time keeping them connected to my phone. They pair fine initially, but after about 10 minutes, the audio cuts out completely. I’ve tried resetting them and forgetting the device on my iPhone, but the issue persists. Can someone help me troubleshoot this? I need them for my commute.
